## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This project helped-me a lot with two important topics of web develepment, the first, wich i was struggling a lot, was media queries and resposive design, after this project my confidence grow, because i was abble to do it quite nice, and with no stress. The second topic tha helped me was the mobile-first work flow, this was my first experience building this way, and i liked.

### Continued development

I think that i still have a lot to learn in CSS, there's a lot of content that is not teached in basics courses, i could use CSS grid to get more confidence, so i will work on that...

### Useful resources

- [Web Dev Simplified Positions video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx5jmI0UlXU) - This helped me to understand how the positions values works finally.

## Acknowledgments

My tip for who is beggining just like me is: practice.
When you are tired and procrastinating, practice more.
Sometimes you are tired to finish the project that you started, go and do it, maybe you concludes with 5 lines of code....
